                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I’m a Sales Engineer with 15 years of experience in both pre-sales and post-sales roles. I’ve always been drawn to technology—not just how it works, but how it can be used to solve real problems. I love exploring new tools, tinkering with ideas, and finding creative ways to build better solutions. That curiosity is what keeps me excited every day.</p>
                <p>When I’m not working, my world revolves around my three little girls. They keep me on my toes, constantly learning, and always laughing. And when I do get a little time to myself, you’ll probably find me diving into AI—experimenting, building, and seeing what’s possible.</p>
                <p>One thing I truly believe in is the power of knowledge sharing. My goal is to make sure every sales rep I work with walks into their meetings feeling confident and well-prepared from the technical side of the conversation. Watching them succeed is just as fulfilling as any win of my own.</p>
